/*
You have two strings,  and . Find a string, , such that:

 can be expressed as  where  is a non-empty substring of  and  is a non-empty substring of .
 is a palindromic string.
The length of  is as long as possible.
For each of the  pairs of strings ( and ) received as input, find and print string  on a new line. If you're able to form more than one valid string , print whichever one comes first alphabetically. If there is no valid answer, print  instead.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of queries. The subsequent lines describe each query over two lines:

The first line contains a single string denoting .
The second line contains a single string denoting .
Constraints

 and  contain only lowercase English letters.
Sum of |a| over all queries does not exceed
Sum of |b| over all queries does not exceed
Output Format

For each pair of strings ( and ), find some  satisfying the conditions above and print it on a new line. If there is no such string, print  instead.

Sample Input

3
bac
bac
abc
def
jdfh
fds
Sample Output

aba
-1
dfhfd
Explanation

We perform the following three queries:

Concatenate  with  to create .
We're given  and ; because both strings are composed of unique characters, we cannot use them to form a palindromic string. Thus, we print .
Concatenate  with  to create . Note that we chose these particular substrings because the length of string  must be maximal.
