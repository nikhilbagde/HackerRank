/**
 * Created by Nikhi on 10/19/2016.
 * ASCI team did one awesome job, all small latter from a to z have their 6th but as 0
 * and all upper letter A to Z have their 6th digit as 1. keeping all other bits same.
 * So to convert lower case to upper case, we just have to change its 6th bit.
 *
 * Now to change 6th bit, we will have to use EXOR as .  0 ^ 1 = 1 ( 0 changed to 1)   again same 1 ^ 1 = 0 (original zero)
 *                                                       1 ^ 1 = 0 (1 changed to 0) again same 0 ^ 1 = 1 (original 1)
 *
 *  But from where we can get 1 as 6th bit and all other zero consider 64 bit number.
 *  we have space  ' ' character value as 32 and it has only 6th bit as 1 and all other zero.
 *  Hence we can use it to exOr with 6th digit as 1.
