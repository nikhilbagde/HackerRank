/**
 * Created by Nikhi on 11/5/2016.
 * Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 Example:
 Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

 Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
 return [0, 1].
