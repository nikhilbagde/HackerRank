As she browses the music section of the store for new albums, she finds that there are N albums . All of the Alice's favourite albums lie in a range [L,R] (1<=L<=R<=N).

Alice wants to buy as many albums as possible. She wants to choose albums in such a way that price of each albums is evenly divisible by K, her favourite number.

Given N(number of albums) and price of each album you have to answer Q queries of form L R K where you have to tell maximum number of albums that Alice can buy in the range [L,R] and are perfectly divisible by K.

Input:

First line contain N i.e number of albums.
Next line contains N integers denoting price of each album.
Next line contains Q i.e number of queries.
Next Q line contains three integers L R K.
Output:

For each query print maximum number of albums that Alice can buy satisfying her conditions.
